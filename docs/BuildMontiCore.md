by executing the following configuration: 

    git config --global core.autocrlf input
    
## Build MontiCore

MontiCore is currently partially still built using maven, but partially 
already migrated to gradle. It is recommended to use the MontiCore internal gradle
wrapper (`gradlew`).

Please note that from the top level build script, not everything is built and 
all tests executed. It is a deliberate decision, to exclude some of the longer 
lasting tasks.

* build the productive code (including the unit tests, ~8 min)
`mvn install`
  * skipping the unit tests: `mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true`
* run integration tests (which are not included in the unit tests, ~30 min)   
  * Integration tests of the generator: 
    * maven (deprecated): `mvn install -f monticore-generator/it/pom.xml` or 
    * gradle: in `monticore-generator/it/` call `gradlew build`
  * EMF Integration tests of the generator: 
    * maven (deprecated): `mvn install -f monticore-generator/it/pom.xml -P emf-it-tests` or 
    * gradle: in `monticore-generator/it/` call `gradlew build -PbuildProfile=emf`
  * Experiments (from the Reference Manual) as integration tests:
    * maven (deprecated): `mvn install -f monticore-generator/it/experiments/pom.xml` or
    * gradle: in `monticore-generator/it/experiments/` call `gradlew build`
  * Grammar integration tests:
     * in `monticore-grammar/monticore-grammar-it` call `gradlew build`
  * TemplateClassGenerator integration tests 
    * maven (deprecated): `mvn install -f /monticore-templateclassgenerator/it/monticore-templateclassgenerator-it/pom.xml` or 
    * gradle: in `/monticore-templateclassgenerator/it/monticore-templateclassgenerator-it` call `gradlew build`
* clean:
  * call `mvn clean`
  * cleaning integration tests:
    * using maven (deprecated): `mvn clean` (including the `-f` argument, see above) 
    * using gradle `gradlew clean` within the corresponding directory (see above)
