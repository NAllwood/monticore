/* This is a MontiCore stable grammar.
 * Adaptations -- if any -- are conservative. */

/**
 * This grammar defines four generics: List<>, Map<,>, Set<>
 * and Optional<> on top of basic types.
 * 
 * These four generics correspond to a typical predefined set of generic 
 * types for example used in connection with UML class diagrams or the
 * OCL.
 * UML associations typically have those association multiplicities and 
 * therefore these types are of interest.
 * 
 * This eases the reuse of type structures in languages similar to Java,
 * that are somewhat simplified, e.g. without general generics.
 *
 * This grammar is part of a hierarchy of types, namely 
 * * types.MCBasicTypes.mc4       
 * * types/MCCollectionTypes.mc4  
 * * types/MCSimpleGenericTypes.mc4
 * * types/MCFullGenericTypes.mc4    
 * also defining generics or arrays.
